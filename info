export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

To run your Flask application, follow these steps:

Install the necessary packages: If you havenâ€™t done so already, youâ€™ll need to install Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Login. You can do this using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal and type:
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_login

Set the FLASK_APP environment variable: This tells Flask where your application is located. If your main application file is app.py, you can set the variable like this:
export FLASK_APP=app.py

On Windows, use set instead of export:

set FLASK_APP=app.py

Run the application: You can now run your application using the flask run command:
flask run

This will start a development web server, and Flask will give you the address where you can access it (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Remember to run these commands in the directory where your app.py file is located. Also, these instructions assume that youâ€™re using a virtual environment. If youâ€™re not, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip, and python3 -m flask run instead of flask run.

Please note that this will run the app in development mode, which is not suitable for deploying in a production environment. If youâ€™re planning to deploy your app, youâ€™ll need to use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. Youâ€™ll also need to set the FLASK_ENV environment variable to production and set up logging so that you can see any errors or warnings that occur. If you need help with this, please let me know!
